Added Structure:

    int mess_table[][] in kernel/proc.h, a matrix recording the value of messages sent between processes.

    int mess_table[][] in servers/is/dmp_kernel.c, a matrix saving received data corresponding to its counterpart in     kernel.

    p_starttime in proc struct in proc.h

Added Macro:

    GET_MESSTAB in include/minix/com.h, defining a new kind of request in get_info system call

    sys_getmesstab in include/minix/syslib.h, defining a new inline function, invoking sys_getinfo

Modified and Added Function:

    messtable_dmp in servers/is/dmp_kernel.c, obtaining process table and message matrix from kernel, and then     printing out the number of messages between some processes.

    proctab_time_dump in servers/is/dmp_kernel.c to show the process
    table with times.

    do_exit in kernel/system/do_exit.c, setting the corresponding row and column of the terminated process to 0.

    do_getinfo in kernel/system/do_getinfo.c, adding a case GET_MESSTAB in switch to handle the data transfer     between kernel and is.

    modified do_fork in kernel/system/do_fork.c to save process start
    time in proc struct.

    main in kernel/main.c, initializing the message matrix.

    mini_send and mini_notify in kernel/proc.c, incrementing the corresponding value in message matrix to match the     sent message.

Whole Picture:

    When F1 is pressed, the modified dmp.c will invoke mess_table in dmp_kernel.c, which obtains data from kernel        through modified system call-sys_getinfo.
