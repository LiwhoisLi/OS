For this problem, I added a field at the end of the proc struct
defined in proc.h to store the uptime in ticks at process start time.
I modified do_fork.c to store the start time when each process is
forked.  Finally I altered pick_proc() so that it, after selecting a
queue in its normal fashion, searches through the queue for the
process with the latest start time and schedules that one to run.

I also added some code to the info server to print the process times,
including creation time, with SF6.
